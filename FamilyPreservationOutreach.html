    <h2>Family Preservation Outreach</h2>
<br>
    <text>Residents of Hamilton County can email gasmithys@gmail.com and request a gift card for food, gasoline, crockpot, shoes, etc. There is no qualification. We only ask for name, address and number of family members.</text>
<br>
    <text>Glenda A. Smith Youth Sanctuary is additionally distributing free gift cards to Avondale, Blue Ash, Colerain and Lincoln Heights through volunteers representing Community Councils, Health Department and Police Department. Because these entities have “boots on the ground” they are magnanimously blessing a lot of people. Thank you.</text>
