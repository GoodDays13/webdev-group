    <text>On Friday, June 11, 2021, a student and I were at New Prospect Baptist Church, for an event formerly called Fish & Loaves. We met a lot of people and informed the attendees about the nonprofit. It was a lot of fun. By having a booth at the event Glenda A. Youth Sanctuary contributed to New Prospect community youth camp that has 80 attendees. Below are photographs of this event.</text>
